# Earthquakes from around the world.
### Earthquake data is gathered from US Geological survey website and plotted on the world map.
The map displays major earthquakes measured within the past 30 days.
The darker the circle, the deeper the epicenter; and higher magnitude quakes are indicated with proportionally larger circles.

Flattening the world map creates a lot of distortion - especially at the northern and southern extremes.  This distortion can make lower maginitude quakes in the higher latitudes appear more significant than larger quakes closer to the equator.  Click on the quake markers to check the actual magnitude.
